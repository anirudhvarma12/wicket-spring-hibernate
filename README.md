# wicket-spring-hibernate
This is an Apache Wicket project, pre-configured with Spring & Hibernate.
To get started, clone this repo and start working

##Whats this?
* Persistence.xml : This file is in the resources/META-INF folder, contains information related to your database.
* beans.xml : This file is in the resources folder and contains information required to run Spring.
* web.xml : This file is in the webapp/WEB-INF folder. It contains the ContextLoaderListener which creates a Spring container for all your components as well as the location of your beans.xml.

* I work heavily with Apache Wicket, this was made as a quickstart to avoid configuration headaches. If you found this useful for yourself, amazing. If you found any issues you can open a ticket or submit a pull request.
